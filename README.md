# Introduction to Function Programming @ Trinity College Dublin

This is a compilation of the various exercises given to us as a form of continuous assessment for the module 'Introduction to Functional Programming' at Trinity College Dublin.

## Grade by Exercise

I am putting the grades obtained here so that you know to which degree of 'correctness' I completed the exercises in.

Keep in mind that this is my first Haskell code _ever_ and is far from perfect. My reasoning for giving this table below is so that you do not assume that the code works, and you can fix it yourself(effort).

| Exercise | Grade  | Failed Test Case                                                                           |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ex1      | 10/10  | -                                                                                          |
| Ex2      | 19/20  | Q4T7:!:(42 [Just 2 Just 999]) ?:(40 [Just 2 Just 2 Just 999])                              |
| Ex3      | 17/20  | Q3:!:Divide (Value 2.0) (Value 0.0) ?:Divide (Value 2.0) (MulBy (Value 3.0) (Value 0.0)) â€¦ |
| Ex4      | 25/25  | -                                                                                          |
| Ex5      | 19/25  | No clue tbh(This was barely even Haskell)                                                  |
| Total    | 90/100 | -                                                                                          |

## Thoughts

This module was overall quite fun for me, although it was _extremely_ painful at times. The enjoyment came out of writing the language itself, although some of the questions were questionable.

If you want to learn useful skills like pattern matching, which can also be found in languages like Rust, this may be the langauge for you.

Writing Haskell code has you thinking about recursion, heavily. If you want to hone in your recursive function writing skills, I recommend this module.

Even if you just want to learn a new beautiful language, I can definitely recommend this module.

Don't take my word for it however, check out the code, and watch some videos on the topic.
